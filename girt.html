          Get It Right Enterprises provide visualization products to help train sports officials. Get It Right allows officials to learn rules through interaction and visualization rather than by just reading the rules. Not only can officials benefit from these visuals, but these animations can also help coaches explain the rules to their student-athletes. Their goal is to “Make Sports Safe for Kids”.

          <h1>Process</h1>
          <p>
            When we first started working with Get it Right, they were using Joomla for their website. Joomla was limiting the design for the marketing site and also preventing them having a store to sell their software online. We planned two phases with them to help improve their site.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the first phase, we created a store site for them. The goal was to design a user friendly store that complemented the Joomla site, but was also made in a way that it could be reused once the site was converted.
          </p>

        </div>

        <div class="description float-l">
        <p>
          The second phase was to covert Get it Right's website from a Joomla site to a custom website and combine with the store site. The majority of this work was done by a teammate.
        </p>
        <p>
          The client's business was growing, but customers were having trouble finding where to purchase the software on the site, and the homepage was cluttered with too much content. I convinced the customer to redesign the site in a way that would profit their buisness.
        </p>
        <p>
          I met with the customer several times to learn about the company and its users, and then I designed a site that focused on the heart of the product and allowed users to easily purchase the software. By simplifying the homepage and reducing the amount of clicks to download the software we increased increase the number of conversions.
