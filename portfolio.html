    <h1> The Smith Family Clinic for Genomic Medicine </h1>
    <p>
      The project was to create a web-based portal (Genome Gateway™) to manage the interaction between patient and clinic. The goal was to allow doctors and patients to interact even when it was not possible to meet in person. Requirements included, chat, video calls, forms, and an education portal.

      <h2>Design Process</h2>
      <p>
        We had a really short deadline to get this project completed so we needed to create something that would be able to meet the client's and user's needs while still hitting the deadline. Through some itterations and some great team work we got the product out the door before the clinic's opening.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Met with clients to get requirements and a feel for the different types of user and how they would be using the app.
        </li>
        <li>
          I did some quick hand wireframes and met with my team to make sure we were all on the same page and to get feedback. I itterated on the design and we got it approved by the client before making mockups.
        </li>
        <li>
          Created mockups in Sketch App and again itterated with the team before getting feedback from the client.
        </li>
        <li>
          After getting the design approval from the client, I wrote up the HTML and CSS for the project.

    <h1>Get it Right Training</h1>
    <p>
      Get It Right Enterprises provide visualization products to help train sports officials. Get It Right allows officials to learn rules through interaction and visualization rather then by just reading the rules. Their primary focus is directed to the officials, but these same animations can help coaches explain rules to their student-athletes. Their goal is to “Make Sports Safe for Kids”.
    </p>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>
      When we first started working with Get it Right they were using Joomla for their website. Not only was it limiting the design for the marketing site it was also preventing them having a store to sell their software online. We planned two phases with them to help improve their site.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first phase, we create a store site for them. The goal was to design a user friendly store that matched that seemlessly went with the Joomla site, but was also made in a way that it could be reused once the site was converted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second phase was to covert the site from a Joomla site to a normal website. The majority of this work was done by a teammate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The client's business was growing, but customers were having trouble finding where to purchase the software on the site and the homepage was cluttered with too much content. I worked to convince the customer to redesign the website.
    </p>
    <p>
      I met with the customer several times to learn about the company and users and I designed a site that focused on the heart of the product and allowed users to easily purchase the software. By simplifying the homepage and reducing the amount of clicks to download the software we increased increase the number of conversions.
