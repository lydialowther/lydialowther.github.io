      The project was to create a web-based portal (Genome Gatewayâ„¢) to manage the interaction between patient and clinic. The goal was to allow doctors and patients to interact even when it was not possible to meet in person. Requirements included, chat, video calls, forms, and an education portal.

      <h2>Design Process</h2>
      <p>
        We had a really short deadline to get this project completed so we needed to create something that would be able to meet the client's and user's needs while still hitting the deadline. Through some itterations and some great team work we got the product out the door before the clinic's opening.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Met with clients to get requirements and a feel for the different types of user and how they would be using the app.
        </li>
        <li>
          I did some quick hand wireframes and met with my team to make sure we were all on the same page and to get feedback. I itterated on the design and we got it approved by the client before making mockups.
        </li>
        <li>
          Created mockups in Sketch App and again itterated with the team before getting feedback from the client.
        </li>
        <li>
          After getting the design approval from the client, I wrote up the HTML and CSS for the project.
