          I am a problem solver. There are problems that every project has such budget, time, and technology constraints and there are problems that are specific to projects, users, and clients. Creating the best solution for the user does not actually solve a problem if the client can't afford the solution. I enjoy finding solutions that meet the needs of everyone involved.

          Through college and for a short time after I pursued having a career in Cake Decorating. I enjoyed listening to customers, sketching a cake design that met their needs, and creating a cake that was personal to them. I still enjoy decorating cakes, but I realized that it was the process that I enjoyed the most. I started to see the need for that same process in software and sought out the field of UX design.

          After doing a lot of research and training, I left my career in cake decorating and pursued UX Design and development. The mediums are different, but the process is the same. I listen to a customer, discover their needs and their users needs, create wireframes and mockups, and write up the HTML and CSS for the app or webpage. I have really enjoyed working in this field and hope to continue helping others through user-centered development.
